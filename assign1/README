How to compile:
   simply run the command 'make all'
   this will make all of the required 
   binaries and object files to run 
   kdc, idA, and idB

Running executables:
    
    kdc:
        ./kdc
        This will initiate the key distribution host. 
        This program must be run before idA, it will 
        block until its socket accepts a connection.

        After the connection is accepted, you will be 
        prompted for thr session key, as well as idA 
        and idBs private keys. This program takes no 
        command line arguments

    idA:
        ./idA <kdc hostname or IP address> <idB hostname or IP address>
        This program is the one that inplements sends 
        the file to idB after securing a connection. 
        If there are no command line arguments given, 
        the program will seg-fault, and it will throw 
        a runtime error if you don't start the other 
        programs first. 

        After a connection to the KDC is established,
        you will be prompted to input a private key 
        (must match what is given to kdc) and a nonce
        integer for authentication. After the secure
        key distribution, and a secure connection to
        idB is established, you will pick from a menu
        of options. You can send a short message to 
        test encryption, which will then prompt you
        to enter a message, or you can send a file,
        which will prompt you for a file name.
        The third option is exit, which will close 
        the program and also close idB
        
    idB:
        ./idB
        This executable is the easiest to run. Once 
        ran, it will prompt you for a provate key, and 
        an integer nonce value. If idA chooses to send
        a file, you will be prompted for the name of an 
        output file. The program exits once idA chooses
        the exit option.
